### Permissions

- **Authenticated Users**: Can create, view, update, and delete their own posts, transactions, farmlands, and insights.
- **Admin Users**: Can manage all users' data and have full access across endpoints.
- **Role-Based Access**: Specific endpoints (e.g., deleting or updating other usersâ€™ data) are restricted based on user role (admin vs. user).

   - Primary fields: `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `password`

2. **Farmland**:
   - Primary fields: `user`, `sensors`, `size`, `location`
   - Each farmland belongs to a specific user and may generate data from sensors located on the farmland.

3. **Insight**:
   - Primary fields: `title`, `content`, `date_posted`, `user`, `farmland`
   - Insights are generated from Machine Learning models based on data from sensors attached to a specific farmland.

4. **Product**:
   - Primary fields: `name`, `description`, `price`, `quantity`, `photo`

5. **Cart and CartItem**:
   - Primary fields: `user`, `product`, `quantity`

### Future Enhancements

- **Notifications System**: Alert users of low stock, new insights, or significant changes in farmland metrics.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Allow users to generate custom reports on transaction history or farmland productivity.
- **Analytics**: Visualize insights and trends based on sensor data to help users optimize their farms.
